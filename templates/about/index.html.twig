                            My fascination with electronic music began with the hypnotic rhythms of **house, techno, and trance**.
                            From the pulsating basslines of <strong>Daft Punk</strong> to the mesmerizing melodies of <strong>Armin van Buuren</strong>, every track sparked my creativity.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Electronic music is limitless. It blends technology and art, allowing producers to create futuristic sounds that push the boundaries of music.
                            Whether it's the deep vibes of **progressive house**, the energy of **big room**, or the raw power of **industrial techno**, each subgenre tells its own story.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Over time, my passion grew beyond listening—I wanted to **create**. Experimenting with DAWs like <strong>Ableton Live</strong> and <strong>FL Studio</strong>,
                            I started producing my own tracks, blending deep bass, synth arpeggios, and atmospheric pads to craft unique electronic soundscapes.
